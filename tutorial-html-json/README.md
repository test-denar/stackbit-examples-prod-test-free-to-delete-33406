# Stackbit Tutorial [HTML + JSON]

ℹ️ This project is used as a starting point for [a getting started tutorial](https://docs.stackbit.com/getting-started/html-json) using JSON files in the `src/pages` directory as the content source.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you are using Node v14 or newer.

## Project Setup

Use the `create-stackbit-app` command to create a new project:

    npx create-stackbit-app@latest --example tutorial-html-json

This will create a new instance of this project in a `tutorial-html-json` directory and install dependencies. Change into the new directory and start the development server.

    cd tutorial-html-json
    npm run dev

Visit `localhost:3000` and you should see the example content. Now you can continue with the tutorial!
